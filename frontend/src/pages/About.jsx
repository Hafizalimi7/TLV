          <p>
            My name is Tanya, and my journey to becoming a healthcare provider has been deeply shaped by my personal connection to cancer. Coming from a family with a significant history of cancer, I have seen firsthand the impact that cancer has on individuals and their families. This experience has fueled my passion to support and guide people who are navigating the challenges of cancer care.

            I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Radiotherapy and Oncology from St. Georgeâ€™s University of London in 2023. This program provided me with a solid foundation in the science and clinical practices of cancer treatment. During my three years of study, I completed placements at the Royal Marsden Hospital in Chelsea, a world-renowned institution specializing in cancer care.

            In 2024, I completed a Masterâ€™s degree in Cancer and Clinical Oncology at Queen Mary University of London. This advanced program deepened my understanding of cancer biology, treatment modalities, and clinical research. My dissertation focused on the efficacy of dual-targeted inhibitors in overcoming resistance in HER-2 positive breast cancer, a project that honed my research skills and contributed to the growing body of knowledge in targeted cancer therapies.
